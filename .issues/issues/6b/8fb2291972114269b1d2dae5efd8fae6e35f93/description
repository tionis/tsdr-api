<blockquote>
<h1>Changelog</h1>
<h2>v7.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Existing <code>HMSet</code> is renamed to <code>HSet</code> and old deprecated <code>HMSet</code> is restored for Redis 3 users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>v7</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Important</em>. Tx.Pipeline now returns a non-transactional pipeline. Use Tx.TxPipeline for a transactional pipeline.</li>
<li>WrapProcess is replaced with more convenient AddHook that has access to context.Context.</li>
<li>WithContext now can not be used to create a shallow copy of the client.</li>
<li>New methods ProcessContext, DoContext, and ExecContext.</li>
<li>Client respects Context.Deadline when setting net.Conn deadline.</li>
<li>Client listens on Context.Done while waiting for a connection from the pool and returns an error when context context is cancelled.</li>
<li>Add PubSub.ChannelWithSubscriptions that sends <code>*Subscription</code> in addition to <code>*Message</code> to allow detecting reconnections.</li>
<li><code>time.Time</code> is now marshalled in RFC3339 format. <code>rdb.Get(&quot;foo&quot;).Time()</code> helper is added to parse the time.</li>
<li><code>SetLimiter</code> is removed and added <code>Options.Limiter</code> instead.</li>
<li><code>HMSet</code> is deprecated as of Redis v4.</li>
</ul>
<h2>v6.15</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cluster and Ring pipelines process commands for each node in its own goroutine.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6.14</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added Options.MinIdleConns.</li>
<li>Added Options.MaxConnAge.</li>
<li>PoolStats.FreeConns is renamed to PoolStats.IdleConns.</li>
<li>Add Client.Do to simplify creating custom commands.</li>
<li>Add Cmd.String, Cmd.Int, Cmd.Int64, Cmd.Uint64, Cmd.Float64, and Cmd.Bool helpers.</li>
<li>Lower memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>v6.13</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ring got new options called <code>HashReplicas</code> and <code>Hash</code>. It is recommended to set <code>HashReplicas = 1000</code> for better keys distribution between shards.</li>
<li>Cluster client was optimized to use much less memory when reloading cluster state.</li>
<li>PubSub.ReceiveMessage is re-worked to not use ReceiveTimeout so it does not lose data when timeout occurres. In most cases it is recommended to use PubSub.Channel instead.</li>
<li>Dialer.KeepAlive is set to 5 minutes by default.</li>
</ul>
<h2>v6.12</h2>
<ul>
<li>ClusterClient got new option called <code>ClusterSlots</code> which allows to build cluster of normal Redis Servers that don't have cluster mode enabled. See <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/go-redis/redis#example-NewClusterClient--ManualSetup">https://godoc.org/github.com/go-redis/redis#example-NewClusterClient--ManualSetup</a></li>
