More robust mensa csv parser

The current mensa csv parser doesnt have any checks for the validity of the file besides very basic error checking. Thus following changes should be implemented:
 - Check if plan is same as one year ago (to prevent corona bug)
 - Check if line counts match up, and maybe parse it with dictionary
